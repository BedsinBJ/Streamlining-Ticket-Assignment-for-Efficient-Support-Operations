📘 Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations

🧩 Project Overview
This project aims to improve the efficiency of support operations by automating and optimizing ticket assignment within a customer service or IT helpdesk environment. The traditional manual method of assigning tickets can lead to delayed responses, uneven workloads, and decreased customer satisfaction. This system proposes a smart, rule-based, and scalable ticket routing mechanism to ensure that every ticket is automatically assigned to the most suitable support agent.

🎯 Objectives
Reduce response time and improve service quality.

Automate ticket routing based on skills, category, and workload.

Ensure balanced work distribution among agents.

Enhance transparency through an analytics dashboard.
